# Crab ðŸ¦€
Please read the Crab file of your respective language, and bow down to our god.

## Integration
1. Place the appropriate Crab file into its special folder, appropriately named `crab/`
2. Make helper functions that crash the program every time it starts if Crab is not located.
3. Crab ðŸ¦€

## General Rules
1. Have the Crab description of doom.
2. Have a class or struct or equivalent named `Crab`.
3. Class/struct/whatever must have the crab in there commented out, and it must be the only contents.
4. Absolutely nothing destructive please. Unless it is for the glory of crab. /j
5. Crab ðŸ¦€

## Milestone
1. All programing languages have crab.
2. Crab ðŸ¦€

## A good example would be the Crab.rs and Crab.java file, look at that if you're confused.
